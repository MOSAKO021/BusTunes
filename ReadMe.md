🎧 BusTunes – Tired of Bus Fights Over the AUX Cord? Us Too. 🎧
The Bus: A Peaceful Place... Until It’s Not
Ah, the bus ride. A serene, peaceful journey. That is, until someone decides they need to blast their song, right now, at full volume. 🙄

One minute, you’re minding your business, and the next, it’s AUX CORD THUNDERDOME. One person’s dying for some 80’s ballads, another insists on blasting dubstep at 7 a.m., and THEN there’s that one guy who thinks it’s cool to play… whale mating calls? 🐳 Seriously, dude?

🎉 Enter BusTunes – The Hero We Deserve! 🎉
Say goodbye to the Great Bus Music War of 2024! With BusTunes, we’ve finally solved the problem: a playlist everyone can add to (without throwing hands), where songs are played in a fair order (gasp!) and reviewed by an all-powerful Admin (you know, the one with actual music taste).

Here’s the deal:

Add your song 🎵: Got a favorite jam? Add the name, YouTube URL, and (optional) a note explaining why your taste in music is superior.
Wait in line ⏳: It’s first in, first out – like a drive-thru, but for music. Add your song fast or risk spending the ride jamming to “Whale Songs Volume 2.”
Admin's in charge 🔥: If your song’s a dumpster fire, the Admin will throw it out (gently). You’ll know why, too, because the Admin actually gives feedback. Revolutionary, I know.
Why You Need This (Unless You Like Bus Drama) 💁‍♂️
Orderly chaos: Add your song without needing to wrestle someone for the AUX cord. Because fistfights over playlists? Not a vibe.
Fair play: First come, first served. The sooner you add, the quicker you’ll hear your tune. No queue jumping. Yes, Karen, we’re talking to you.
Playlist preview: See the songs already added before you contribute. Avoid being that person who adds “Bohemian Rhapsody”... again. We get it, it’s a classic. Please stop.
Admin as the DJ: The Admin reviews and removes songs that are, well, questionable. So no worries, that Death Metal Meditation mix won’t see the light of day (hopefully).
Features That Make You Go 🤯
Add Songs 📝: Anyone can add a song. Yes, even the guy who keeps suggesting polka.
FIFO Playlist ⏳: First In, First Out. Songs are played in the exact order they’re added. No sneaky skip tricks.
Admin Powers 🚫: The Admin has the God-like power to review and remove inappropriate songs (with a reason, because transparency is cool).
Removal Notes 📝: Find out exactly why your song got removed. Was it too “experimental”? Or just terrible? Either way, you’ll know.
How It Works (Because You’re Curious)
Log in: Enter your name, roll number, and bus number. Yes, we need these. No, you can’t skip this step. No fake names either, Brad. We’re watching you.
Add your song: Enter the song name, YouTube URL, and (if you’re feeling chatty) why it’s the best song in the world.
Wait: Yep, you’ll need to wait your turn. No skipping, no whining. Democracy at its finest.
Listen & Chill: Sit back, relax, and enjoy the tunes (or pretend to if someone added “Cotton Eye Joe” for the 50th time).
Admin’s Superpowers (Because Someone Needs to Be in Charge)
Congrats, Admin! You now have the power to:

Approve or delete songs at will. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, but we’re hoping you’ll just use it to delete bad music.
Add removal notes: Let people know why their song was removed. It’s like giving them closure... for their terrible taste.
What’s Coming Next (If We Ever Feel Like It)
User Voting: Let the people decide which songs stay or get skipped. Democracy? Risky.
Genre Filters: No more death metal surprises on your chill commute. 🎸
Mood Playlists: Want to chill? Set the mood! Or, just hope no one selects “Gym Playlist” on your peaceful 7 a.m. ride. 🏋️‍♂️
Installation (Because You Might Actually Want to Use This)
